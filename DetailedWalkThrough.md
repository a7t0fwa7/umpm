# 1. `shared.h`

### Path:

```
c:\Users\a7t0fwa7\Documents\Github-Work\umpm\shared.h
```

### Purpose:

This header file contains shared definitions and declarations used by both the user-mode and kernel-mode components of your project. It sets up the necessary types, includes, and namespaces based on whether the code is being compiled for kernel-mode or user-mode.

### Breakdown:

1. **Include Guards:**

   - `#pragma once` ensures the file is included only once during compilation.
2. **Mode-Specific Includes and Definitions:**

   - **Kernel Mode (`_KERNEL_MODE` defined):**
     - Includes `<ntifs.h>`, a Windows Driver Kit header for file system drivers.
     - Defines fixed-width integer types (`int8_t`, `uint8_t`, etc.) within the `std` namespace.
   - **User Mode (`_KERNEL_MODE` not defined):**
     - Defines `NOMINMAX` to prevent Windows headers from defining `min` and `max` macros.
     - Includes `<Windows.h>` and `<cstdint>` for Windows API and fixed-width integer types.
3. **Namespace `driver`:**

   - Wrapped in `#ifndef _KERNEL_MODE` to ensure it's only available in user-mode.
   - Defines an `enum class control_codes` with custom IOCTL codes (`create_recursive_pte`, `invlpg`) using the `CTL_CODE` macro.
4. **Disable Specific Compiler Warning:**

   - `#pragma warning(disable: 4201)` disables warning 4201, which relates to nameless struct/union usage.
5. **Union Definitions for Page Table Entries:**

   - Defines several `union` types (`pml4e_t`, `pdpte_1gb_t`, `pdpte_t`, `pde_2mb_t`, `pde_t`, `pte_t`, `virtual_address_t`, `self_ref_t`) representing different levels and types of page table entries in the x86-64 architecture.
   - Each union provides both a 64-bit `value` and a structured view of individual bit fields, allowing for easy manipulation and access to specific parts of the page table entries.
   - `virtual_address_t` and `self_ref_t` are used to dissect virtual addresses and self-referencing addresses, respectively.

### Usage:

This header serves as a foundational piece, providing necessary types and structures for memory management and driver communication. Both UM and KM components include this to ensure consistency in data structures and communication protocols.

## 2. Kernel-Mode Driver: `main.cpp`

### Path:

```
c:\Users\a7t0fwa7\Documents\Github-Work\umpm\km\main.cpp
```

### Purpose:

This is the entry point and main implementation of a Windows kernel-mode driver. The driver facilitates low-level memory manipulation by exposing IOCTLs (Input/Output Controls) that can be invoked from user-mode applications.

### Breakdown:

1. **Includes and Definitions:**

   - Includes `<ntifs.h>` for kernel-mode functions and structures.
   - Includes `"../shared.h"` for shared definitions.
   - Includes `<intrin.h>` for compiler intrinsics like `__invlpg`.
2. **Custom `print` Function:**

   - `print`: A helper function to print debug messages using `vDbgPrintEx`.
3. **IOCTL Dispatch Function (`dispatch`):**

   - Handles incoming IOCTL requests.
   - **Supported Control Codes:**
     - `create_recursive_pte`: Creates a recursive Page Table Entry (PTE) for manipulating page tables.
     - `invlpg`: Invalidates a page in the Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB) for a given virtual address.
   - **Operation for `create_recursive_pte`:**
     - Retrieves the current Process Environment Block (PEB) and translates a given virtual address.
     - Validates and manipulates page table entries to establish a self-referencing PTE.
     - Copies the old Page Frame Number (PFN) to allow restoration.
     - Flushes the TLB entry for the modified virtual address using `__invlpg`.
   - **Operation for `invlpg`:**
     - Invokes `__invlpg` to invalidate a specific virtual address in the TLB.
4. **Driver Entry Point (`DriverEntry`):**

   - Sets up the driver, creating a device (`\\Device\\UMPM`) and a symbolic link (`\\DosDevices\\UMPM`).
   - Sets up major function handlers for `IRP_MJ_CREATE`, `IRP_MJ_CLOSE`, and `IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL`.
   - Configures the device for buffered I/O and finalizes initialization.
5. **Driver Unload Function (`DriverUnload`):**

   - Cleans up by deleting the symbolic link and the device upon driver unload.

### Usage:

This kernel-mode driver provides the backend for memory manipulation functionalities exposed to user-mode applications. It allows user-mode code to create and manage recursive PTEs, enabling direct interaction with system page tablesâ€”a powerful capability often used in advanced memory management tools or systems programming.

     - Accepts a control code (`control_codes`), input buffer, input size, and optional output buffer and size.
     - Prints error messages if the IOCTL call fails.
     - Returns `true` on success and `false` on failure.

### Usage:

This module abstracts the complexity of interacting with the kernel-mode driver. It allows other user-mode components to initialize communication with the driver and send IOCTLs without dealing directly with Windows API calls. This abstraction simplifies the code in other parts of the user-mode application.
